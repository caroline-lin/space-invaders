# Space Invaders
ASCII space invaders you can play on a *NIX terminal.

## Prerequisites
You should have the ncurses library installed. On Ubuntu, install with:

```sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev```

ncurses should also be available on Mac OS and other Linux distributions.

## Compiling
Just type 'make' at your terminal from the install directory once ncurses is installed :).
To run the program, type './space_invaders'.

## About
I this from scratch in C over a weekend, partly for fun and partly for an interview.

As an FYI, there's a widely-available ASCII space invaders on Ubuntu: <http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/artful/man6/open-invaders.6.html>

## TODO
* ability for player to fire bullets
* scorekeeping
* nicer alien sprites
* speedup alien movement to enhance drama
